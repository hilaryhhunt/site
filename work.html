                      <h5 class="card-title">"This Land is Whose Land" StoryMap from GEOG 572</h5>
                      <p class="card-text">This story map was created as part of my enrollment in Professor Rob Rothâ€™s 
                        Geography 572 Graphic Design in Cartography course, taught in Fall 2022 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
                        When I left the nonprofit world for academia, one of my primary goals was to gain more skills in GIS and cartography, 
                        which I had been using on a functional but rustic basis for years. Prior to this course, my engagement with cartography was limited to static maps: monitoring and creating conservation easements, grant reports, and occasionally fundraising and publicity. 
                        With all of these maps, there was minimal engagement between viewer and map. Geography 572 was a unique and valuable experience for me as I gained skills 
                        in visual storytelling, bivariate mapping, and combining maps with other types of visual information to tell a story. 
                        As I approach the spatial components of my dissertation, I am eager to think through using maps and visual storytelling in new ways. 
                        There is an interesting story told here about the commonalities between conservation lands and Morrill Act lands, and the legacies of these two very American traditions.</p>

                    land in the nine-county region of Southwest Michigan served by the Conservancy. Acknowledging climate change as the largest threat to ecologial health in the region,
                    SWMLC committed itself to the organization-wide priority of identifying and protecting the most climate resilient areas, as these areas would be the most important for 
                    biodiversity, recreation, water quality, and adaptation into the future. This plan details the process by which our team identified these areas
                    and set a course for their future protection. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">In lieu of a traditional Master's thesis project, my MS program placed students in teams during the last semester
                    of my Master's degree to complete a capstone project, in which students solve significant management projects on behalf of nonprofit organizations.
                    Our team worked on behalf of the Albany Parks & Recreation Foundation, which had been recently founded and was in need of substantial
                     organizational development, including help with financial management, establishment of founding documents, accountability and compliance to IRS 
                     regulations, and community engagement. Through our consultancy, we addressed all of these needs, creating tools, documents, policies and systems to 
                    ensure the longterm success of the Foundation.</p>
