<h6> Hello and thank you for visiting my website! I am a current Environment & Resources PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Nelson Institute. 
My research investigates the ways in which land conservation frameworks can function both to protect biodiversity and 
to improve social outcomes for the people involved. In my work, I have coined the term "collectivist conservation frameworks" to refer to these
 frameworks. My scholarship draws on the traditions of political ecology, alternative economies, and feminist, anti-essentialist Marxist thought.
Within the Nelson Institute, I belong to the Robbins Lab, led by Dr. Paul Robbins, Dean of the Nelson Institute. My other roles at UW include
Teaching Assistant in Nelson's Environmental Conservation MS program, where I teach year-round: Environmental Studies 972: Conservation Planning (Fall), 
Environmental Studies 978: Conservation Planning - Advanced Methods & Practice (Spring), Environmental Studies 843: Land Use Policy & Planning (Summer).
I am also a Graduate Associate at the Center for Culture, History, and Environment, and involved in a cross-departmental collaboration on 
remedial land justice following Morrill Act expropriation of Indigenous land.

Before coming to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I worked for the Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy as the Director of Land Protection and formerly 
as a Land Protection Specialist. Prior to that, I spent several years in Oregon involved with land trusts and ecological restoration nonprofits. Thus, I draw on
deep and varied experiences and skills gained in the nonprofit land conservation sector, and have significant expertise in all aspects of land conservation, 
including funding, acquisitions, assessment, restoration, and stewardship.
